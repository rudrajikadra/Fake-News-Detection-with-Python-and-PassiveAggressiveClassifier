# Fake News Detection with Python and PassiveAggressiveClassifier

This is my Machine Learning model created with PassiveAggressiveClassifier to detect a news as Real or Fake depending on it's contents. It uses TfidfVectorizer which converts a collection of raw documents into a matrix of TF-IDF features.

Upon running the Jupyter Notebook we get the accuracy of 93.05% which is not that great but reasonable enough!
