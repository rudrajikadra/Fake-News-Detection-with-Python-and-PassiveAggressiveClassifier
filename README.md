# Fake News Detection with Python and PassiveAggressiveClassifier

This is my Machine Learning model created with PassiveAggressiveClassifier to detect a news as Real or Fake depending on it's contents. It uses TfidfVectorizer which converts a collection of raw documents into a matrix of TF-IDF features.
